## Usage Examples

### Track Failed Login Attempts

```
1. Trigger: Webhook (receives login failure from your app)
2. LiteSOC Node: Create Event
   - Event Type: auth.login_failed
   - Actor ID: {{ $json.user_id }}
   - Actor Email: {{ $json.email }}
   - User IP: {{ $json.ip_address }}
   - Metadata: { "reason": "invalid_password" }
```

### Auto-respond to Critical Alerts

```
1. Trigger: Schedule (every 5 minutes)
2. LiteSOC Node: Get Many Alerts
   - Filters: severity=critical, status=open
3. IF Node: Check if alerts exist
4. Slack Node: Send notification to #security channel
5. LiteSOC Node: Resolve Alert
```

### Route Alerts by Severity

```
1. Trigger: Webhook (alert webhook from LiteSOC)
2. Switch Node: Route by {{ $json.severity }}
   - critical → PagerDuty
   - high → Slack #security
   - medium → Email security team
   - low → Log for review
```

## Severity

**Important:** Severity is automatically assigned by LiteSOC based on the event type and threat detection rules. You cannot manually set severity when creating events.

**Event Severity Levels:**
- `critical` - Immediate action required (privilege_escalation, brute_force)
- `warning` - Requires attention (login_failed, mfa_disabled)
- `info` - Normal activity (login_success, logout)

**Alert Severity Levels:**
- `critical` - Active attack or breach
- `high` - Significant threat detected
- `medium` - Suspicious activity
- `low` - Minor anomaly
